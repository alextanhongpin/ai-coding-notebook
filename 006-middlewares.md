# Middlewares and Proxies


We have middlewares/proxies everywhere, from http routers to microservices (sidecar proxy).

They are usually there to modify behaviour of the system by altering some property or injecting new capabilities (logging, telemetry, authorization etc).


In the near future, we dont need to worry about such cross cutting concerns and just focus on business logic, as they can all be generated.
