# Building Software

Building software requires different set of capabilities.


With LLMs and Github Copilot, we (humans) will no longer need to spend too much time writing code. However, those time will instead be spend on 

- reviewing generated code
- optimizing and evaluating prompts
- sending those prompts to army of agents
- designing evaluation metrics

When we have the proper workflow (AIDevOps? lol I started this) in place, then any non-technical people such as Product Managers (sorry) can also start building softwares by just communicating to the system through natural language.

In fact, humans have already been using natural language as a way of communicating what to build.

We have user stories, specification by example, even cucumber for testing.

## Workflow

The workflow will remain unchanged, and starts with the specification by examples or user stories. These are essentially zero shot learning (double check this).

From this specification, we already have the base of what to build.

We can further tell the model to improve on this specification, and even generate more examples and find edge cases.

From this specification, we can translate them to actual implementation code, as well as test cases.
