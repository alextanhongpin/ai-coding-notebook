# AI Coding Assistant

AI can act as assistant for software engineers to effectively deliver software.

Understanding and providing the right instructions through prompting is essential to get the most out of AI assistant.

The evaluation metrics of each prompt should be measured.

Github Copilot can already do the following
- write code based on comment
- refactor
- fix
- write tests
- search documentation for relevant info
- suggest PR description
- suggest commit messages
- do code review

All of these keeps us in the flow.


But those capabilities are just for coding, and building software is not the same.

In subsequent articles, we will explore how we can further utilize LLMs like ChatGPT and/or Github Copilot to ease development workflow.
