# Coding tools

To make tools more AI-friendly, they have to have a lot of metadata that describes what the tool does.

This is similar to Open AI functions, where each function is defined by the JSON Schema.

This is similar to SEO, and will potentially be some feature in Github so that in the future, AI models simply know what package to use etc.
