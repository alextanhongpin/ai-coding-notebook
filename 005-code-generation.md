# Code generation

Why should you depend on Github Copilot to generate the code instead of you manually writing it?


I can think of a few reasons, from saving time and keeping developers in the flow.

However, one huge win is the removal of bias and ego in coding.

We no longer need to worry about preferences in styles etc, as we might not need to know whats the underlying implementation in the future as AI gets better and better at generating code.
We just need to know if the funtion executes as expected.

I foresee a spec like document where humans can just input more examples instead of writing tests. Models will generate those tests and just validate the input/output.
